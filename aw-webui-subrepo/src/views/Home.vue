h3 Hello there early user!
p
  | It's still early days for ActivityWatch. We've come a long way but we currently need users (like you!) to provide feedback and help us turn ActivityWatch into a successful project.
  | Your interest as an early user means extra much to us, and we hope you'll reach out to us with any ideas you have for improvements!
p
  | If you are a developer we hope you take a peek at the documentation (found in the links below) as well as try to write a watcher, visualizer or some other tool to help build an ecosystem (it's easy!).
p
  i Thanks for using ActivityWatch!
